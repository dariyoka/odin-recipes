The odin recipes website is a site containing (for now only 3) cooking recipes of my favourite dishes!

During this project I becamne used to writing the html boilerplate from memory, created a simple recipe website with 3 recipes with the same template. I implemented all of my knwoledge of html elements that I acquired through odin project lessons. 

Moreover, I used my git knowledge on practice! I was scared to use it at first because I only knew the theory, but I realised that using git , especially staging and commiting files, is not that scary as I had thought!

I am planning on remastering the website once I become comfortable at using css as well, and I think the website will be going through a lot of modifications during my web dev journey
