  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><strong><em>Lagman</em></strong> or <em>laghmen</em> is one of the most famous dishes of Uyghur, Uzbek, Kazakh and
    Kyrgyz cuisines. In summary, it
    can be said to be hand pulled noodles served with a meat sauce. The sauce and service may vary according to the
    cuisine. For example, in Uzbek cuisine, it is made more juicy and usually by adding potatoes, while in Uyghur
    cuisine, the sauce is dehydrated to a large extent.</p>
  <p>
    To make lagman, the dough is first formed into thin cylinders, just like when making simit or pretzels. After the
    cylinders are abundantly oiled, they rest for a while to soften. After they are softened, they are thinned out by
    pulling them as if spinning a yarn from wool. Thinned noodles are wind around two hands like a hank yarn. Noodles
    wrapped in two hands are tapped on the counter with quick movements, making them even thinner. After all the dough
    is made into noodles in this way, it is cooked immediately. In fact, all of them are easy steps, but since these are
    not used in other recipes, it can be difficult to understand or visualize by reading.

      <li>Ground black pepper 1gr </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the dough ingredients in a mixing bowl, knead them to make a smooth dough cover with a damp towel or plastic
      wrap and set aside in room temperature, for 15- 20 min.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, cut the vegetables for cooking, display them on a plate, so it's easier to put them in the frying pan
      later.</li>
    <li>When the dough is rested, roll it into a dough coil. Cover it with kitchen foil, so it doesn't dry out, set
      aside, for 15-20 min.</li>
    <li>Cooking the topping: Use the biggest fire to heat up the oil over high heat, when you see light smoke, add the
      lamb and brown them. Then put the ginger, garlic, hot red chili, dried tomato, onion and fresh tomato into the
      pan, mix all, cook for 2-3 min. Then add the yard long bean, peppers, scallion and spices, mix all the
      ingredients, cook for 3-4 min.</li>
    <li>Add water, bring it to a boil then move it to the smallest fire and let it simmer.Get boiling water ready for
      boiling the noodle.</li>
    <li>Stretch the dough coil: Start with the dough coil on top. Hold the end of the coil between your thumb and index
      finger of your right hand. loosen up 30 cm of the coil from the plate, bring it above the working surface.

      Now place your left index finger and thumb right next to the index finger and thumb of the right hand. Hold the
      noodle lightly.

      To stretch the noodle thin (5mm). Move your arms to the sides, while the noodle slides between your left thumb and
      index. Repeat until you stretched the whole rope</li>
    <li>To make the noodle cords: Put the end of the stretched rope, between your index and middle finger (right hand.)

      Now with your left hand Lift the noodle onto the palm edge to make a "first cord" (keep your palms open, faced
      each other in a body width distance.)

      Move the right hand clockwise and keep the left palm facing the right (as if you're holding a beach ball between
      your hands) to touch the hanging noodle so you'll create the ''second cord.''

      Turn the right hand from the wrist, 360 degrees around the noodle. Now the palms are facing each other again. Now
      catching the noodle on your right palm edge, rotate your arms counterclockwise and slip your left hand under the
      hanging noodle to catch it on your left palm edge. This is the “third cord ”. You should keep the same distance
      between your arms during the whole process. Making sure not to stretch the noodle.

      Repeat this ''cord making'' process until you reach the end of the rope.

      Pick up the end carefully with your fingers, while you still keep the cords whole, put the end between your index
      and middle fingers.</li>
    <li>To make the noodle dance: At this point, you wrapped up your hands with lots of ''cords'', WHAT MAGIC!! Now keep
      your palms facing each other, and move your arms vertically up to hit the cords shortly on the table.
      When hitting the table carefully stretch the noodle by moving your arms out. Let the cords “dance” elegantly.
      Repeat this 3-4 times. (Some cords may break, it’s fine, just enjoy hitting the cords and dance with them )</li>
    <li>To boil: Put the noodle into the boiling water, move the noodles around immediately so they won’t stick to each
      other. Cook 2 to 3 minutes.

      Take the noodles out with a strainer, shortly wash it in cold water, so they stop cooking. Strain out all excess
      water.</li>
    <li>Serve it warm in a deep diner plate and place the topping on top of the noodles. Use Laghman chili sauce as a
      dressing. Mix them all.

      It's our tradition to drink boiled noodle water along with Laghman, try that and hope you ENJOY!!</li>
